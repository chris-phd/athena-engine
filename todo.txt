## Currently working on:
- add opening book to improve game openings
  - https://www.hiarcs.com/chess-opening-book-free.html
  - http://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html#openings

## Deployment
- app not deploying succesfully on digital ocean. Maybe try using the bitnami image, since that launched on it's own?

## Bugs
- perft not generating the correct number of legal moves after cetain depth. [maybe black tries to capture the king? who knows]
- castling seems to be broken now??

## Features
- Improve aesthetics of the timer.
- Make the timer functional. Set start time using the config menu

- perf optimisations

- implement draw if there is not enough material for both sides to checkmate (kings only)
- implement draw if 50 moves pass without a piece being captured

- remove circular dependencies between board, pieces and rules submodules
